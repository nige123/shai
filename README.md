shai (SHell AI)

LLM-powered utility for generating and executing shell commands.

It's OK to feel shy about executing a command suggested by an LLM.

The shell command does not execute without your confirmation. Be careful when confirming. 

Usage:

    shai ask for what you want              -- in plain spoken language
    
    shai what processes are using the most memory 
    shai how much disk space is left
    shai what programs have ports open
    shai remove .tmp files larger than 100 meg 
    
    shai config                             -- change LLM settings
    shai help                               -- show this help
